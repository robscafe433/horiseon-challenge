# Horiseon first week challenge

## Horiseon company mock web page


The motivation for this project was to practice the "Scout Rule" of leaving the code a little cleaner than I found it.   Changing html elements so as to make the code easier to follow, more precise/descriptive element names. Also the importance of alt attributes for accessibility. The importance of a logical html structure and that of a great title. 

This solved the problem of html element names being to vague. CSS also made for a better
user experience making page easier to visually follow. Also changing title name to
a more precise name lets user know they are at the right webpage.

I learned how implementing the use of:

 semantic html elements
        helps make the code (html,css) easier to follow and read by myself and others.

 logical structure
        makes for a smoother user expeience on the webpage. 

 Heading attributes
        are important because they organize the content and subsections.

 proper title name
        lets user know they are at the right webpage.

 use of alt attributes
        importance of using alt attributes is for accessibility like
        the visually impaired.
